# 🧠 Model Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on machine learning model implementations and experiments, built as part of my self-guided learning in predictive modeling and supervised learning techniques. The goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of classic and modern algorithms through practical applications across both regression and classification tasks.

## 🗂 Project Overview

Each subfolder in this repository focuses on a specific model, data type, or task. The models implemented include:

### 🔍 Regression Models
- **Linear Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**
- **Neural Network Regression**
- **Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HGBRegressor)**

### ✅ Classification Models
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Neural Networks (NN)**
- **Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HGBClassifier)**

## 📊 What You'll Find in This Repo
- Clean and commented Python notebooks (`.ipynb`) for each model
- Preprocessing workflows using `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `numpy`
- Visualizations and model evaluation metrics
- Comparative model performance summaries

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚧 Status
This is a work-in-progress repo that will continue to evolve as I explore more advanced models, hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and cross-validation techniques. Expect updates regularly.

## 📂 Folder Structure
Will be added soon!

## 💡 Learning Goals
- Strengthen foundational understanding of ML algorithms
- Apply models to real datasets
- Compare model performance
- Build intuition for model selection and trade-offs
